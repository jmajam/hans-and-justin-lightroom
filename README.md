# Overview of Beginner's Lightroom Tutorial

This is a guide that is meant to provide a tutorial on basic functions, as well as introduce two common editing styles. Some components of Lightroom that are introduced include:

* file importing/exporting,
* image cropping,
* blemish removing, and
* colour editing.

## Developing Our Guide

Our primary sources for the production of this guide mainly came from "Writing in the Technical Fields: A Practical Guide" by Thorsten Ewald, and from our instructor, Sam Lee. 

The process of creating instructions was broken into three main categories:
* Introduction
* Step-by-Step Instructions
* Conclusion

We were careful to include the relevancy of the topic for each set of instructions, as it was important to us to introduce the practicality and usefulness of the task. We learned that stating the necessity of the objective leads to better readibility and understanding of the instruction.

Step-by-Step instructions were the essential core of the project. There were many standards to uphold for conveying clear instructions, such as the use of effective graphics. We made sure that our instructions were clear and worked well will with the additional notes, cautions, and subdivisions of text that were accompanied. Our final check was by testing our instructions with peers and getting feedback on what to improve.

The conclusion was our way of checking in with the user and repeating back the expectation. Doing so allows for the user to be reminded of the goal of the instruction and to go back to their work if they accomplished the task.

## Choosing our Editing Styles

We wanted to introduce two styles that were popular and relevant to the average user. Doing research on popular social media such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram, we saw a trend of similar photos. Some the posts that got the most attention on social media were edited in a "soft and warm" style. This style was popular for its ability to convey After watching a couple of tutorials, our team was able to figure out how to replicate it ourselves and put into instructions for others to learn. The other style we were interested in was known as "professional portrait" because we saw many uses for it for professional and personal use. Its versaility of uses drew us to picking this to use for our tutorial.

## Conclusion

Perhaps the biggest setback to this project was COVID-19, an epidemic infectious disease that spread widely in 2020. Due to the situation going beyond our control, our team was not able to meet and work together in person. Communication and work ethic became an evident issue until tensions rose as the deadline approached. In the end, we were finally able to push through together after a couple of midnight work sessions. We are proud to have accomplished the completion of this project amidst the circumstances and to have picked up new knowledge in Markdown Syntax Documentation and GitHub.
