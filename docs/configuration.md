# Basics
{: .no_toc }


Before any editing can begin, we must be able to import pictures and start new projects. Lightroom features non-destructive editing which means that the original content is not modified. This allows for the ability to keep the first version of the file and produce as many edits and manipulations as desired.

## Table of contents

## Importing
In order to begin your project, you need to bring in the photo(s) you want to manipulate.
    1. Go to **File** -> **Import Photos and Videos**
    2. Select a source by using the navigation panel to locate your folder.

## Exporting
Files can be converted to a specified file type, which is useful for uploading to different websites or attachments.
    1. Click **File** in the top left corner, and then **Export**.
    2. Choose the location on your computer to store the file in the export location section.
    3. OPTIONAL  Rename the file by clicking on the **Rename To** box and type in a name.
    4. Click **Export**.
    
## Cropping
Unnecessary parts of an image can be removed by cropping.
    1. Go into Develop mode by using _Ctrl_ _+_ _Alt_ _+_ _2. 
    2. Hit _R_ to use the crop overlay tool. A grid should appear on top of the image.
    3. Drag the edges of the grid until the grid is on the desired area.
    4. Hit _R_ again to exit the tool.
    5. Fit the image to your screen by clicking **Fit** on the top right of the navigator


Congratulations, you now know the basics on getting started. We can now start editing photos!
