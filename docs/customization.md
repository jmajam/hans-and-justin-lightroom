    *  Develop mode can also be accessed by using _Ctrl_ _+_ _Alt_ _+_ _2_. 
## Basic Tool
1. Click on **Basic**.
2. Go to the **Exposure** slider, and move the dot to the right to increase the overall brightness of the image.

2. Ensure that the channel is "RGB" 
3. Click on three dots that are evenly spaced on the diagonal line inside the tone curve.
4. Drag the bottom left dot down and the top left dot up. The line should resemble an "S"

## HSL/Colour
1. Click on **HSL/Colour** under the **Tone** **Curve** tool.
2. Adjust the **Red**, **Orange**, and **Yellow**  hue sliders to control the photo warmth.

## Additional tips
* Increase the **Temperature** slider inside **Basic** for more warmth, giving the image a more red or rosy tint.

There are many other ways to make a picture more sentimental. Not every photo will be edited exactly the same.
Some require different levels of balance between light and dark colours, depending on how the original photo was captured.
It will take some playing around, but practice makes perfect, and it’s always good to have an ideal photo for reference.
