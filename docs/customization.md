Adding warm tones to a photo is a great way to bring life to the subject. This method of editing is powerful for bringing out emotion in a picture. Editing this way is useful for conveying intimacy social media and family photos.

For the sake of this example, we will be using [this photo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16mQI5Y9X9KMN1-mToQWb_Y3nB1uTcSdd/view?usp=sharing).

  * Develop mode can also be accessed by using `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `2`. 
    
## Basic Tool

We'll start our editing by going over the basic adjustments. It's broken down into 3 main groups:
* White Balance (WB)
* Tone
* Presence

We'll be mostly using _White Balance_ and _Tone_ to bring up the light and make it look soft.

![basic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmajam/hans-and-justin-lightroom/gh-pages/docs/images/Warm2.png)

1. Click on **Basic**.
2. Go to the **Exposure** slider, and drag the slider to the right by +2.00.
   * This increases the overall brightness of the image.
3. Go to the **Contrast** slider, and lower the contrast by -50.
   * This contributes to creating a faded photo by bringing out the dark colours.
4. Go to the **Temperature** slider, and add warmth by moving the slider to 5800.
   * This changes the white balance in the photo and adds more yellow, orange, and red.
5. Go to the **Tint** slider, and add more pink by moving to +6.
   * Drag carefully, this slider is very sensitive.
   * The overall effect gives the image a rosy tint.
6. Go to the **Shadows** and **Blacks** sliders, and increase them by +50.
7. Go to the **Whites** and **Highlights** sliders, and decrease them by -50.
   * The overall effect of manipulating these sliders creates a hazy and softer tone. 
   * The dark colours become lighter while the light colours become darker.
8. Adjust all sliders until it is to your liking.
   * Aim to ensure that the picture is bright, warm, and faded.

## Tone Curve
To create a more faded dreamy effect, we can bring out our dark colours and dampen our light colours.

1. Scroll down and click on **Tone Curve** under the **Basic** tool.
2. Ensure that the channel is set to _RGB_ .
3. Add dots by clicking on the line on the graph.
   * Ensure they are evenly spaced.
   * You can drag the nodes to readjust them.
4. Drag the bottom left dot down and the top left dot up. 
   * The line should resemble to a stretched-out "S".

## HSL/Colour
We can complete our last adjustments by bringing out more/less of certain colours. Using the HSL/Colour sliders, we can choose how they look and how bright they'll be.

1. Scroll down and click on **HSL/Colour** under the **Tone** **Curve** tool.
2. Under _Hue_, adjust the **Red**, **Orange**, and **Yellow** sliders to control the shade of each colour.
   * I've made mine more darker shades of red and orange.
3. Under _Saturation_, adjust the **Red**, **Orange**, and **Yellow** sliders to control the intensity of each colour.
   * I've decreased mine to keep that "hazy" feel.

## Conclusion
There are many other ways to make a picture more sentimental. Not every photo will be edited exactly the same.
Some require different levels of balance between light and dark colours, depending on how the original photo was captured.
It will take some playing around, but practice makes perfect, and it’s always good to have an ideal photo for reference. Warm photos are great for showing off themes of passion and affection.
