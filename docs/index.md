This is a basic guide to getting started with Adobe Lightroom. Use the links on the left to navigate through the document and learn how to edit photos. After covering the [Basics](https://jmajam.github.io//hans-and-justin-lightroom/docs/), two common editing styles are introduced to get you started.

These instructions were made in mind for users with little to no experience working with Adobe Lightroom. The version used in the production of this page is with Lightroom v8.2.1.10.
